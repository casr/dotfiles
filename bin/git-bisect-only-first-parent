# NAME
#      git-bisect-only-first-parent - bisect only first parents
#
# SYNOPSIS
#      git bisect-only-first-parent [<bad> <good>]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#      Sometimes the most interesting thing about a bisect is which merge
#      introduced the error (i.e. branch) and not the exact commit. After
#      having begun a bisect, this command can skip commits which are not first
#      parents from consideration.

BAD=$1
GOOD=$2

usage() {
	printf 'usage: %s [bad] [good]\n' "$(basename "$0")"
}

if [ $# -lt 2 ]; then
	usage
	exit 1
fi

for rev in $(git rev-list "^${GOOD}" "${BAD}" --merges --first-parent); do
	git rev-list $rev^2 --not $rev^
done | xargs git bisect skip
