# NAME
#      att - attach to tmux
#
# SYNOPSIS
#      att
#
# DESCRIPTION
#      Present a list of projects found under `~/Projects`. A project is
#      determined to be something that has a `.git` directory at its top-level.
#
#      The session name is derived from everything between the `.git` directory
#      and `~/Projects`.


# We fix `project_root` to this directory as session names are derived from the
# file system hierarchy and allowing this to be configurable would open us up
# to session name clashes.
project_root="${HOME}/Projects"
session_name=$(
	( cd "${project_root}" || exit 1; find -sL . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 4 -path '*/node_modules/*' -prune -o -type d -exec test -d '{}/.git' \; -prune -print ) | \
		cut -c3- | \
		fzy --line 15 --prompt "Choose a project ❯ "
)

# Likely outcomes are that the user aborted the input with C-d or that input
# was added but it did not result in a match in which case we filter out
# non-existing project directories.
