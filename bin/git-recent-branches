# NAME
#      git-recent-branches - list the most recently checked out branches
#
# SYNOPSIS
#      git recent-branches [amount]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#      List the most recently checked out branches by scanning the reflog. It
#      defaults to up to 10 results although it can be configured by passing an
#      amount in.

# Assign Perl script to variable like this to make it easier to read than a one
# liner. $ must be escaped \$.

my \$matched_lines = 0;
my %seen;
while (<>) {
	# take only the first X results (defaults to 10)
	if ( scalar %seen >= ${1-10} ) { last }
	print "\$1\n"
		# find all times a checkout occurred in reflog
		if /checkout: moving from \S+ to (\S+)/
		# skip the first matched line as this is the current branch
		and \$matched_lines++ > 0
		# if we have already 'seen' this branch then skip printing
		and !\$seen{\$1}++;
}
