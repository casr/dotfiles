Simple staging for dotfiles
===========================

  1. Clone in the dot files for your favourite programmes.
  2. Convention:
     a) Adhere to a *-conf/ directory structure.
     b) Use a *-conf/install.sh file to instruct symlink locations.
  3. Run ./install

Submodules are encouraged and will be updated as part of the `install` script.

See https://github.com/casr/dotfiles-vim for an example.
